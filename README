-= Overview

This program will work only on Linux.

To build everything run 'make'.

Simple test can be done with

    ./encrpyt < README | ./cryptrobber > README.copy

The test should show that original text is written in english
and that default key is 31 32 in hex.  Since the key can be anything
it is printted in hex, but you can lookup ASCII to find what string it is.
Decrypted README will be in README.copy.

-= Project Structure

'base' directory contains strans translator and smack macro processor.
STS files in project root directory are main files of corresponding programs.
'encrypt' will encrypt its input with hardcoded key.  You can use it as:

    ./encrpyt < file_to_your_file > path_to_save_encrypted_data

'cryptrobber' will try different keys on it input, and if deciphered text
will met requirements cryptrobber will output predicted language and key.
So the thing is breaking encrypted files, use it as:

    ./cryptrobber < path_to_encrypted_data > path_to_save_decrypted_data

This software can determ if text is in english or in spanish.
Language and kwy in hex will be outputed into error stream.
